# Pre-words

Thought the best efficiency will obtained with string praser, I don't want to
implement it this way.

This code is implement with regex, with the platform Visual Studio 2019. You
can just clone this project, and open with VS2019, and then build it.


# Post-words

I don't plan to maintain this code, at least no-frequently update will be
avaliable.  This tool is mainly for self-usage.

I hope this tool will help somebody else, and if so, please email me:
